# Magento Docker Compose - Local Magento Setup / Test Environment

## Introduction

This Docker Compose configuration is designed to create a local development environment for Magento 2. It provides a quick and easy way to set up Magento with PHP, MySQL, OpenSearch, Redis, and other necessary components in Docker containers. It also included MailHog for Email Testing.

## Setup

1. **Rename the `.env_magento2xx` file**

    Rename the `.env_magento2xx` file to match your desired Magento version. For example, if you're using Magento 2.4.7, rename `.env_magento247` to `.env`.

2. **Start the Docker containers**

    Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers:

    ```sh
    sh docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. **Access the PHP-FPM container**

    To get shell access to the PHP-FPM container, run:

    ```sh
    sh docker exec -it Mage247-PHP-FPM bash
    ```

4. **Download Magento**

    A sample download script (`download_magento247.sh`) is provided to help you download the Magento installation files. Run the script to download Magento.

5. **Run Magento Installation**

    Once the Magento installation files are downloaded, use the provided installation script (`install_magento247.sh`) to set up Magento.
